Hyperbench, the hyper HTTP benchmarking tool

Origins
=======
Most open source HTTP benchmarking tools were designed in an era when
threads/forking was the norm to handle concurrent requests. Over time, servers
moved on to use efficient non-blocking I/O inspired by the "C10K" problem. The
benchmarking tools however did not make a similar transition. In effect, things
came down to a point wherein the existing tools would saturate CPU and/or memory
much earlier than the servers that they were pounding. This utility is written
in the new-age style and is able to pound the servers much harder than its
competitors.
