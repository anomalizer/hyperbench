How to compile?
===============

Get yourself the following:
 * JDK 1.6
 * maven 2.x
Then, just run the following command:
mvn install

And your hyperbench is ready. Invoke your code as
java target/hyperbench-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar <options>

$ java  -jar target/hyperbench-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
Usage: <main class> [options]
  Options:
    -c   Max concurrency
         Default: 1
    -f   Input file name
    -n   Total number of requests to be issued
         Default: 1
    -u   The url to be invoked


Either one of -u or -f option needs to be passed. Example of the expected file
format can be found in src/test/resources
